# Trigger_sequencer

This Arduino based trigger sequencer is a powerfull eurorack module for rhythmic purposes for any diy synthesiser enthusiast.

## Features
- external clock input
- 3 trigger channels
- 8x8 led matrix display with vertical step axis and horizontal is probability axis
- create patterns on the fly with build in "euclidean rhythms" generator
- change length of each trigger
- change clock multiplier for each channel
- change duty cycle of each output
- shift a pattern vertically for steps and horizontally for its probability.
- Toggle switch for manual edit mode and edit each note independently
- Set different gate modes for each channel

### Gate modes
- Toggle On / off channel
- Momentary on / off. The channel will only play when gate signal is high
- Step shift. Each gate / trigger signal will shift the sequence downwards
- Step reset
- Step reset + play one sequence
- Generate random steps
- Generate random probality but keep the same steps
